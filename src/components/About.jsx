            Hello! I'm <span className="font-semibold text-white">K M Marziul Karim</span>, a passionate web developer currently pursuing my Computer Science degree. My journey into programming began with curiosity and a desire to create meaningful digital experiences â€” from small websites to complex, user-driven applications.
            <br /><br />
            I love working on both frontend and backend using technologies like React, Node.js, and Firebase. I enjoy building responsive, accessible, and clean interfaces that users love.
            <br /><br />
            Beyond coding, I enjoy photography, watching football, and exploring new tech ideas. I believe in continuous learning, and I'm always looking for opportunities to grow and contribute.
